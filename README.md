# Block jump
Small game I made when learning rust. It might be completely inspired by the dino game from google chrome :P. Just jump over the block.

## Implementation
I made this game by using minifb library which only provides multiplatform buffer functionality and input handling. So I can only change an array of colors. It was pretty fun to make my own rendering functions and work up from there.
